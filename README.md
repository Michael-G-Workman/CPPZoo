# CPPZoo

(c) 2019 Michael G. Workman

I was tasked with creating an object oriented Zoo application in an interview, this is what I created in the C++ programming language.

This application demonstrates object oriented software development with the use of inheritance, each Animal in the zoo has its own class, which is derived from an Animal base class. Animal objects are created in the Zoo application using the NEW keyword, and when the application is finished, the pointer variables to the objects are deleted to prevent memory leaks. C++ does not have garbage collection like Java and C# do, allocated memory must be manually deleted in C++.

THis application was created as a Windows Console Application developed with the Visual Studio IDE,

This application is freely distributable under the terms of the MIT open source license.
